Files included in zip folder:
- nlp.ipynb (main file to be run in a jupyter notebook environment)
- COVID19-GR-0122-0605.pkl (contains ID data in binary)

- config.yaml (used only for configuring the intent classifier)

IMPORTANT: THE FIRST HALF OF THE CODE HAS BEEN COMMENTED OUT SINCE
IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED BECAUSE ALL FILES IT PRODUCES ARE
PACKAGED WITH THIS ZIP FOLDER. TO ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS AS SHOWN
IN THE REPORT AND VIDEOS, IT IS SUGGESTED TO RUN THE MAIN FILE FROM
WITHIN A GOOGLE COLAB ENVIRONMENT. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THEN IT IS
ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO RUN ONLY THE UNCOMMENTED HALF OF THE PROGRAM,
AS IT IS LIKELY THAT COLAB MIGHT PREVENT THE PROPER EXECUTION OF
SOME OF THE COMMENTED OUT ALGORITHMS!!!
