# Question extraction and intent classification using COVID-19 Twitter data
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed during Semester 2 at the University of Luxembourg (February 2022 - June 2022).

The project investigates the feasibility of using an autonomous algorithm for data processing and intent classification. This approach is implemented inside a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate it in practice and provide insight into the effectiveness of algorithm-based data classification.
